- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @blakingtheice.  I currently work at Ecolab doing some data science stuff within the safety department.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in applications of machine learning to help improve the quality of life for people :)
- ðŸŒ± I am about to graduate from my master's program in data science, but I am really intrigued by artificial intelligence.
- Probably going to throw a lot of my random goofy projects on here too haha.
- You can reach me via email at blakingtheice@gmail.com for any questions
