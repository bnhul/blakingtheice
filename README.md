ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Blake!  

Currently I am a data analytics professional working as a HR data analytics lead.

My main areas of expertise are around:
- Consultation, transforming data into actionable insights
- Hypotheses testing and evaluating program effectiveness
- Advanced analytics models (feature extraction, predictive, and prescriptive models)
- Data visualization (Tableau, Power BI, d3)

In this repository, you'll find projects that I am working on for fun outside of work.
