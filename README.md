ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Blake!  

I am currently working as a HR Data Analytics Lead at U.S. Bank.

My main areas of expertise are around:
- Consultation, transforming data into actionable insights
- Hypotheses testing and evaluating program effectiveness
- Advanced analytics models (feature extraction, predictive, and prescriptive models)
- Data visualization (Tableau, Power BI, d3)

My main interests involve making sense of the world with data :).

In this repository, you'll find projects that I am working on for fun outside of work.
